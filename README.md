# c358-final-project

## This is a repo containing code I wrote for the final project
## It involves parallelizing Huffman coding

### Usage:
#### Decode: first make, then ./hc encoded.bin (some encoded binary file) tree.json (some Huffman tree in the required format) 
#### Encode-sequential: first make, then ./hc text.txt (some text file to encode)
#### Encode-parallel: first make, then ./hc text.txt (some text file to encode) #workers (num threads)
